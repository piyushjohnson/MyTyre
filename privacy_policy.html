  <h4>Do we share your information with third party SDKs provider ?</h4>
  <div class="card-panel">
    <span class="black-text flow-text">
     Like any other popular application, Videoder uses a lot of third party SDKs to provide many functionalities. For example MyTyre uses many SDKs to provide in app engagement.  We do not explicitly provide any private information to any of these third party SDK.

Since these SDKs are bundled with the application and have access to all the permissions granted to MyTyre, many of them collect information for identifying users and then targeting them with relevant content. For example Ad networks SDKs generally collect coarse location to better target users with relevant local ads. We at Videoder have made sure that all the SDKs we use in our app are legally compliant with Privacy laws across the globe, including the new GDPR implemented in EU region. The sdks included in the application and links to their privacy policies are provided below:
